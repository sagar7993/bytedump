All data is not worthy of cloud backup and big files such as movies take all the bandwidth while synching, making other internet work slow. Cloud synch depends upon your internet speed plus it exhausts your data allowance. Free cloud storage is tiny. Companies like Drop box giving only 2 GB as free storage and our data is much more than that.

We are working on a cloud storage aggregator platform which gives maximum free space to user and that backup will be enabled from smart disk. On demand data access over internet from smart disk. Smart disk can be used as commercial backup to small and mid size businesses. We can achieve LAN base chat server for businesses.

Zero configuration for every PC and smart phone. There will be a thick client which will automatically discover and connect to smart disk in wifi network. User will have access of his personal and public directory. Auto sync like dropbox : User's devices will auto backup the moment they will get into home network. On demand file access over internet. User can fetch his file from smart disk over internet (This feature will be added in next verion). User can mark a file as sensitive & that file will be saved in encrypted format.
